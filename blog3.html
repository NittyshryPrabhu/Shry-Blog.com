        <p>SCENE OF ONE SHORT OF “If I Do It”  <br>
            [  She says, <br>  If I do it, you will melt with fear <br>

            You will not be anywhere, nor will there be any monster here  <br> 
            
            Forget about you, no one here will be able to touch my hand      <br>
                          If I am the bud of a tree, then know that I am also a thorn     <br>
            
            If I do it then ……………………………………… || <br>
            
            Why should I smile and sway a little, he thinks I am something <br>
            
            You will not be able to do anything here <br>
            
            If I decide, you will not be able to escape <br>
            
            If I do it then ………………………………………|| ]</p>

In Hindi <br>
वह कहती है... 

{ अगर मैं  करूँ तो, खौफ से पिघल जायेगा  <br>

न रहेगा तुम कहीं ,न कोई हैवान यहाँ   <br>
   
तुम तो क्या कोई यहाँ ,छू न सकोगे हाथ मेरा   <br>
 
अगर हूँ मै कली पेड़ की ,तो कांटे भी हूँ ये जान लो   <br>

अगर मैं करूँ तो ……………………………………… ||   <br>

हसकर थोड़ा सा क्या झूम लूँ ,समझता है मै कोई चीज हूँ   <br>

कर न सकोगे तुम कुछ यहाँ   <br>
 
ठान लूँ तो तुम बच न पाओगे   <br>

अगर मैं करूँ तो ………………………………………||   }  <br>
